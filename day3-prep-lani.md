# Day 3 Prep — Lani's One-Pager Session

## Session Overview
**Day 3 — Problem Definition: One-Pager (Wed 02.18.26)**

**Theme**: From insights to a clear problem statement — with AI keeping you rigorous

**Practitioner Lead**: Lani Young

**Format**:
- Main Room (15 min) — Lani demo
- Breakout Rooms (40 min) — Everyone works on their VOC project
- Group Share-Out + Wrap-Up (5 min — in breakout rooms)

## Main Room Demo (15 min)

### What to Cover:
1. How to use AI to synthesize research into a crisp problem definition
2. Using your Day 2 insights as input: define the problem, identify who it affects, size the opportunity
3. Having AI challenge your assumptions and poke holes in your thinking
4. Demo: Take a real customer insights brief → use AI to draft a one-pager with problem statement, supporting data, customer evidence, and proposed direction

### Triad Connection (Your Closer):
"Your one-pager is the artifact that gets alignment from leadership and tells your triad what problem you're solving and why. AI can help you pressure-test your logic before you walk into that room."

## Breakout Room Challenge

**The Challenge**: Use AI agents as role-players

Have Claude take on the roles of the people who would review your one-pager:
- Your EM
- Your PMM
- Your designer
- Your manager
- Lani/JM/Ethan

Have each "role" read the one-pager and push back, ask questions, or engage with it from their point of view. **This is one of the most powerful uses of AI for product thinking.**

## Deliverable
One-pager / problem brief with:
- Problem statement
- Data
- Customer evidence
- Proposed direction

## What You Need to Prep

### 1. Sample Customer Insights Brief (Day 2 Output)
Need a realistic example of what participants will have just created the day before. This is your demo input.

**Should include**:
- Synthesized customer feedback themes
- Pain points
- Opportunities
- Supporting quotes/data

### 2. Live Demo Flow
Show the full journey:

**Step 1**: Give Claude the insights brief + ask it to help draft a one-pager
- Show the initial prompt
- Show the output

**Step 2**: Iterate to make the problem statement crisper
- Show how to refine/iterate the prompt
- Demonstrate 2-3 rounds of refinement

**Step 3**: THE MONEY SHOT — Have AI challenge your assumptions
- This is the unique part of your session
- Show how to explicitly ask Claude to:
  - Poke holes
  - Ask hard questions
  - Play devil's advocate
  - Challenge the problem framing

### 3. The Role-Player Technique Demo
You need to demo this since it's the breakout room challenge.

Show how to have Claude take on specific personas and review the one-pager:

**Example personas to demo** (pick 2-3):
- EM: Will ask about technical feasibility, resourcing, dependencies
- PMM: Will ask about positioning, market fit, competitive landscape
- Designer: Will ask about user experience, edge cases, accessibility
- Manager (Ethan): Will ask about strategic fit, ROI, why now
- Exec reviewer: Will ask about business impact, alignment to company goals

## Next Steps

**Need help with**:
1. Draft a sample customer insights brief (day 2 output) to use as demo input?
2. Build out the specific prompts you'd use in the demo?
3. Script the role-player examples showing different personas reviewing the one-pager?

**Or**:
- Do you already have a VOC problem in mind you want to use for the demo?

## Notes from 3rd Draft Doc (Pages 1-12)

### Program Context
- 84 PMs & designers
- Daily 9-10am MT
- Mon 02.16.26 – Thu 02.26.26
- Everyone working on VOC project they selected in pre-work
- Day 2 (yesterday for them) = customer insights brief
- Day 3 (your session) = one-pager using those insights

### The "Gate" Rule
Each day's deliverable becomes input for next day. Your session is critical because:
- Day 2 output (insights) → Day 3 input
- Day 3 output (one-pager) → Day 4 input (solution options)
- If one-pager is weak, rest of week suffers

### Why This Session Matters
From curriculum: "Not just prompting or prototyping — research, synthesis, problem definition, scoping, design, spec writing, and building. End to end. Every participant will have a deliverable from every stage to prove it."

Your session is where they go from raw insights to **clear problem statement that gets alignment**.
